          <p>
            The ensemble of mosques, minars, and other structures in the Qutb
            Minar complex is an outstanding testimony to the architectural and
            artistic achievements of Islamic rulers after they first established
            their power in the Indian subcontinent in the 12th century. The
            complex, located at the southern fringe of New Delhi, illustrates
            the new rulers’ aspiration to transform India from Dar-al-Harb to
            Dar-al-Islam with the introduction of distinctive building types and
            forms.

            Emperor Shah Jahan commissioned construction of the Red Fort on 12
            May 1638, when he decided to shift his capital from Agra to Delhi.

            Designated by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site, the Elephanta Caves
            are a collection of cave temples predominantly dedicated to the
            Hindu god Shiva. They are on Elephanta Island, or Gharapuri
            (literally "the city of caves"), in Mumbai HarbourThe Elephanta
            Caves contain rock cut stone sculptures, mostly in high relief, that
            show syncretism of Hindu and Buddhist ideas and iconography. The
            caves are hewn from solid basalt rock. Except for a few exceptions,
            much of the artwork is defaced and damaged. The main temple's
            orientation as well as the relative location of other temples are
            placed in a mandala pattern.

          <p>
            Jantar Mantar located in New Delhi is built by Maharaja Jai Singh II
            of Jaipur in the year 1724. The maharaja built five observatories
            during his ruling time in the 18th century. Among these five the one
            in Delhi is the first to be built. The other four observatories are
            located in Ujjain, Mathura, Varanasi, and Jaipur. The objective
            behind the construction of these observatories was to assemble
            astronomical data and to accurately predict the movement of the
            planets, moon, sun, etc. in the solar system. It was one of its kind
            at the time it was built.

            initiatives to restore and maintain the historical observatory and

          The rich heritage of India, one of the world’s oldest civilizations, is
          an all-embracing confluence of religions, traditions and customs. The
          highlights of Indian heritage lie in the treasure of its art,
          architecture, classical dance, music, flora and fauna, and the innate
          secular philosophy of its people. A visit to the heritage sites is like
          a walk through history, changing lanes with every dynasty that ruled
          Indian soils. The finesse of Indian handiwork, the richness of silk and
          cotton textiles, the ethnicity of jewellery, everything has come down as
          a heritage from ancient times and is being kept alive generation after
          generation. Even food in India is a legacy and part of Indian heritage,
          differing in look and taste in every state of India.
